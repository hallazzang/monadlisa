Product Requirements Document: Monad-lisa
Version: 1.0

1. Introduction
   1.1. Vision
   Monad-lisa is a real-time, collaborative, on-chain pixel art canvas. It aims to be a persistent, decentralized piece of collective art, where every pixel's color is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain. It serves as a simple yet powerful demonstration of how communities can build together on-chain, creating a digital artifact that is permanent and collectively owned.
   1.2. Project Goal
   To launch a functional and engaging dApp that allows users to connect their crypto wallets and collaboratively draw on a shared pixel canvas. The primary goal is to create a seamless user experience that abstracts away the complexities of the blockchain where possible, while still highlighting the on-chain nature of the interactions.
   1.3. Target Audience
   Crypto Enthusiasts: Users familiar with dApps, wallets, and blockchain transactions.
   Digital Artists & Creatives: Individuals interested in exploring new mediums for art and collaboration.
   Online Communities: Groups looking for novel ways to engage and create something together.
2. Core Features & Functional Requirements
   2.1. Canvas
   F1: Canvas Grid: The application will feature a central 64x64 pixel grid.
   F2: Responsive Display: The canvas will dynamically resize to fit the user's viewport. Its size will be constrained by the smaller of the viewport's width or height to ensure the entire canvas is always visible without scrolling.
   F3: Initial State: On page load, the application must fetch the current state of all 2,560 pixels from the blockchain smart contract and render them. This ensures every user sees the most up-to-date version of the canvas.
   F4: Real-time Updates: The canvas must update in near real-time for all connected users without requiring a page refresh. When a pixel color is successfully updated on-chain, the change should be reflected on the canvas for everyone. This will be achieved by listening to smart contract events.
   2.2. User Interaction
   F5: Wallet Connection:
   The UI must feature a "Connect Wallet" button.
   Using wagmi, the application will support connecting popular wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet).
   Once connected, the user's wallet address should be displayed.
   F6: Color Selection:
   A user-friendly color palette must be available, allowing users to easily select a color.
   The UI should clearly indicate the currently selected color.
   The color picker design should be based on the provided sketch.
   F7: Pixel Coloring:
   A user must have their wallet connected to color a pixel.
   Clicking on any pixel in the 64x64 grid will trigger a blockchain transaction.
   The transaction will call the smart contract function to update the specific pixel's color to the user's currently selected color.
   F8: Transaction Feedback:
   The UI must provide immediate feedback when a pixel is clicked (e.g., the pixel shows a "pending" state).
   The UI must notify the user of the transaction status (success or failure).
   Upon confirmation, the "pending" state is replaced by the new color.
   2.3. Information Display
   F9: Live User Presence:
   The application will display a list or count of other users who are currently active on the page.
   An "active user" is defined as a unique wallet address with an active session.
   F10: Transaction History:
   A dedicated, toggleable panel will display a list of the most recent pixel-update transactions.
   Each entry should show the wallet address that submitted the transaction, the pixel coordinates, the new color, and a timestamp or link to the transaction on a block explorer.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
   N1: Performance: The initial load should be fast. The canvas rendering and real-time updates should be smooth and not cause significant performance degradation on the user's device.
   N2: Usability: The interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate for both crypto-native and novice users.
   N3: Reliability: The connection to the blockchain node and the event listeners must be stable to ensure data consistency.
4. Technical Stack
   Frontend Framework: Next.js
   Blockchain Interaction: wagmi and viem/ethers.js
   Styling: Tailwind CSS
   Real-time Layer (Presence & Events): A WebSocket server is recommended to manage live user presence and push blockchain event updates to clients efficiently. This avoids each client needing to poll the blockchain directly.
   Target Blockchain: Any EVM-compatible chain.
5. Out of Scope
   Smart contract development (assumed to be provided).
   User accounts/profiles beyond wallet addresses.
   Advanced drawing tools (e.g., fill bucket, line tool, eraser).
   Canvas history playback (versioning).
   Chat functionality.
6. Success Metrics
   Engagement: Number of daily active users (DAU).
   Activity: Total number of pixel-update transactions per day/week.
   Collaboration: Distribution of pixels colored by unique addresses.
7. Mockup Reference
   The UI/UX should be based on the provided visual sketch:
